## 📖 Introduction
**FoodVision Mini** is an end-to-end Computer Vision project designed to classify images of food. Built from scratch using **TensorFlow**, this deep learning model specifically distinguishes between two classes: **Pizza** and **Steak**.

This project utilizes the `pizza_steak` dataset, a smaller subset of the famous **Food101** dataset, making it ideal for rapid experimentation and model benchmarking.

## 🎯 Goal
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of beating the random guessing baseline (50% accuracy) and achieving **~80-85% accuracy** on unseen validation data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.13+
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
